# Fluid_simulation

##### Project proposal 10.25.2019:

This is a WebGL project initially started as a course project for ECSE4750 Computer Graphics.

Here I implement a cude of fluid where users can interactively put in dyes.

The dyes will propogate throught the liquid, the color of the dyes is controlled through a panel and the amount is determined by the amount of time user pressed down the mouse.

There will also be gloabal illumination and shadows implemented.
